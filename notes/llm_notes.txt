Hallucination:

LLMs are designed to generate human-like text based on 
the patterns they’ve identified in vast amounts of data. 
Their primary objective is to provide coherent, contextually 
relevant, and informative responses. However, due to their 
reliance on patterns and the sheer volume of training information, 
LLMs sometimes hallucinate or produce outputs that manifest as 
generating untrue facts, asserting details with unwarranted 
confidence, or crafting plausible yet nonsensical explanations. 
These manifestations arise from a mix of overfitting, biases in 
the training data, and the model’s attempt to generalize from vast 
amounts of information.


Temperature:

LLMs have a temperature, corresponding to the amount of 
randomness the underlying model should use when generating 
the text. The higher the temperature value, the more random 
the generated result will become, and the more likely the 
response will contain false statements. A higher temperature 
may be appropriate when configuring an LLM to respond with 
more diverse and creative outputs, but it comes at the expense 
of consistency and precision. For example, a higher temperature 
may be suitable for constructing a work of fiction or a novel 
joke. On the other hand, a lower temperature, even 0, is required 
when a response grounded in facts is essential.


Missing Information:

The training process for LLMs is intricate and time-intensive, 
often requiring vast datasets compiled over extended periods. 
As such, these models might lack the most recent information 
or might miss out on specific niche topics not well-represented 
in their training data. For instance, if an LLM’s last update 
was in September 2022, it would be unaware of world events 
or advancements in various fields that occurred post that date, 
leading to potential gaps in its knowledge or responses that 
seem out of touch with current realities. If the user asks a 
question on information that is hard to find, or outside of the 
public domain, it will be virtually impossible for an LLM to 
respond accurately. Luckily, this is where factual information 
from data sources such as knowledge graphs can help.


Model Training and Complexity:

Large Language Models (LLMs) are often considered "black 
boxes" due to the difficulty of deciphering their 
decision-making processes. The complexity of these models, 
combined with potential training on erroneous or misleading 
data, means that their outputs can sometimes be unpredictable 
or inaccurate. For example, when asked about a controversial 
historical event an LLM might produce a biased or incorrect 
answer. Furthermore, it would be near impossible to trace back 
how the model arrived at that conclusion. The LLM would also be 
unable to provide the sources for its output or explain its 
reasoning.


Prompt Engineering:

Prompt engineering is an iterative process of crafting 
specific and deliberate instructions that guide the LLM 
toward the desired response. By refining how you pose 
instructions, developers can achieve better results from 
existing models without retraining. For example, if you 
require a blog post summary, rather than asking "What is 
this blog post about?", a more appropriate response would be 
"Provide a concise, three-sentence summary and three tags 
for this blog post." You could also include "Return the 
response as JSON" and provide an example output to make it 
easier to parse in the programming language of your choice. 
Providing additional instructions and context in the question 
is also known as Zero-shot learning.


In-Context Learning:

In-context learning provides the model with examples to 
inform its responses, helping it comprehend the task better. 
The model can deliver more accurate answers by presenting 
relevant examples, especially for niche or specialized tasks. 
For example, if the LLM starts talking about Tim Cook and 
iPhones every time you mention apples, you may want to add to the 
prompt that apple refers to the fruit. Providing relevant examples 
for specific tasks is a form of Few-shot learning.


Fine-Tuning:

Fine-tuning involves additional language model training on 
a smaller, task-specific dataset after its primary training 
phase. This approach allows developers to specialize the model 
for specific domains or tasks, enhancing its accuracy and 
relevance. Fine-tuning an existing model on the nuances of your 
programming language would enhance its capability to write 
performant code. You could also prompt the LLM to generate 
responses in a distinctive style or as if written by a particular 
type of person. For example, "You are an 18th-century poet" or 
"You are an expert programmer in Python". This method is the most 
complicated, involving technical knowledge and domain expertise. 
A more straightforward approach would be to ground the model 
by providing information with the prompt.


Grounding:

Grounding allows a language model to reference external, 
up-to-date sources or databases to enrich the responses. 
By integrating real-time data or APIs, developers ensure 
the model remains current and provides factual information 
beyond its last training cut-off. For instance, if building 
a chatbot for a news agency, instead of solely relying on the 
model’s last training data, grounding could allow the model 
to pull real-time headlines or articles from a news API. 
When a user asks, "What’s the latest news on the Olympics?", 
the chatbot, through grounding, can provide a current headline 
or summary from the most recent articles, ensuring the response 
is timely and accurate.


Data Cut-Off and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid approach that 
combines the strengths of large-scale language models with external 
retrieval or search mechanisms, enabling relevant information from 
vast datasets to be dynamically fed into the model during the 
generation process, thereby enhancing its ability to provide 
detailed and contextually accurate responses. In summary, 
by adding content from additional data sources, you can improve 
the responses generated by an LLM.

The main benefit of RAG is its enhanced accuracy. By dynamically 
pulling information from external, domain-specific sources, a response 
grounded by RAG can provide more detailed and contextually accurate 
answers than a standalone LLM. RAG provides numerous additional benefits,
including: increased transparency, as the sources of the information can 
be stored and examined; security, as the data sources can be secured and
access controlled; accuracy and timeliness, as the data sources can be 
updated in real-time; and access to private or proprietary data.

A note on 'bad data in, bad data out.' When prompting the LLM to respond 
based on the context provided, the answer will always be as good as the 
provided context. If your prompt suggests pineapple as a pizza topping, 
don’t be surprised if it suggests that you order a Hawaiian Pizza.
